# EleetCode-Solutions

A collection of LeetCode problems and their solutions, organized with clear documentation.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a structured format for documenting LeetCode solutions:

### Each solution includes:
1. **Problem Name and Description** - Clear explanation of the problem
2. **Examples** - Input/output examples with explanations
3. **Solution Code** - Actual implementation in multiple programming languages

### Directory Structure

```
EleetCode-Solutions/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── TEMPLATE.md                  # Template for creating new solutions
└── solutions/                   # All problem solutions
    ├── 001-two-sum.md
    ├── 002-add-two-numbers.md

```

## How to Use This Repository

### Adding a New Solution

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point
2. Name your file: `[problem-number]-[problem-name].md` (e.g., `001-two-sum.md`)
3. Save it in the `solutions/` directory
4. Fill in all sections:
   - Problem description and examples
   - Your approach and complexity analysis
   - Code implementation

### Template Sections

Each solution follows this structure:
- **Problem Description**: Brief overview of the problem
- **Examples**: Concrete input/output examples with explanations
- **Constraints**: Problem constraints and edge cases
- **Solution**: Your approach explanation
- **Code**: Implementation in Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, or other languages
- **Notes**: Additional insights or alternative approaches

## Example

See [001-two-sum.md](solutions/001-two-sum.md) for a complete example of how to structure your solutions.

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own solutions or improve existing ones! Please follow the template structure to maintain consistency.
